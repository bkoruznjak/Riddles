 --- 97 --- Three guests check into a hotel room. The clerk says the bill is $30, so each guest pays $10. Later the clerk realizes the bill should only be $25. To rectify this, he gives the bellhop $5 to return to the guests. On the way to the room, the bellhop realizes that he cannot divide the money equally. As the guests didn't know the total of the revised bill, the bellhop decides to just give each guest $1 and keep $2 for himself. Each guest got $1 back: so now each guest only paid $9; bringing the total paid to $27. The bellhop has $2. And $27 + $2 = $29 so, if the guests originally handed over $30, what happened to the remaining $1? --- The $9 paid by each guest accounts for the $2 that went to the bellhop. So rather than adding $27 to the $2 kept by the bellhop, the $27 accounts for the bellhop’s money. The $27 plus the $3 kept by the guests does add up to $30. 
 --- 98 --- Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a sports car; behind all of the others is bicycles. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 2, revealing a bicycle. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 3?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? --- Yes, by changing your answer your chances of winning actually go up from 1/3 to 2/3. <br/><br/>This becomes obvious when expanding the example. Suppose there was 100 doors rather than 3. You pick one and the host shows you that the car is not behind 98 of the doors then asks you to switch to the remaining door or keep the door you picked. Of course you would switch your door because chances are you didn't pick the correct door initially. <br/><br/>For more explanation go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem#Solutions

The number of eggs must be one more than a number that is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 since each of these numbers leave a remainder of 1. For this to be true one less than the number must be divisible by 5, 4, and 3 (6 is 2*3 and 2 is a factor of 4 so they will automatically be a factor). 5 * 4 * 3 = 60. Then you just must find a multiple of 60 such that 60 * n + 1 is divisible by 7. 61 / 7, 121 / 7, 181 / 7, 241 / 7 all leave remainders but 301 / 7 doesn't.

 --- 245 --- Queens can move horizontally, vertically and diagonally any number of spaces as illustrated. One piece 'attacks' another if it moves to the same tile that the other piece is on. How can you arrange eight queens on the board so they cannot attack each other? --- Here are the two solutions. This is usually solved with guess and check although using logic may be faster. We know that each queen must be in its own row vertically and horizontally. We also know that 4 of the queens must be on white and 4 on black. This is true because with 4 queens on the same colour all of the rest of that colour is venerable to attack. (It could be done with math).

The friend who doesn't play golf doesn't play tennis and the one who doesn't play football doesn't play golf. Which sports does each person play? --- George and Tim play all three sports and Paige plays none. <br/><br/>This is assuming girls do not play football. If the school did have a girl's football league all we would know is that one of the three play no sports and the others play all three.

When you take the spoonful of coffee (B) and put it in the tea (A) it increases the volume of the tea (A) by that spoonful. Then when you take a spoonful of the tea (A), part of that spoonful is coffee, taking away the proportional amount of coffee. This makes the amount of coffee in the tea and tea in the coffee equal.

If there was no bullet in that chamber they give the prisoner the option to either spin the chamber again or just shoot again. If the first shot is a blank, should the prisoner ask for the revolver to be spun or should they choose that it be shot again? --- They should have them shoot again. If it is spun again there is a 2/6 chance they will get shot. There are four possible spots that don't have bullets and only one is followed by a bullet.

A very rich young man comes to John's house and says he wishes to marry one of his daughters. Naturally he wants to marry the oldest or the youngest so he will always know if she is lying or telling the truth. John agrees but says he can only ask one of the girls a yes or no question to decide which one he marries. They all look the same age. <br/><br/>What one question does he ask one of the daughters at random to figure out which daughter is the youngest or oldest? --- "Is she older than her?" (He would ask one of the daughters if one of the other daughters is older than the last daughter). He always should pick the younger daughter based on what he knows. If he asks the older daughter and she says yes, then the youngest daughter will be known. If he asks the older daughter and she says no, then the youngest daughter is the other one. If he asks the youngest daughter and she says yes, she is lying and he will still pick the oldest. If he asks the youngest and she says no, he will just pick the other like in the first case. If he asks the middle daughter, it doesn't matter because both will be acceptable choices.

 --- 300 --- Everyday a peasant must pay the king one pound of gold and leave it on a collection plate in front of his house. Every morning a guard comes by to make sure he has put a pound of gold on the plate. The king collects the gold every six days from the plate. If the peasant only has one six pound block of gold, how can he make only two parallel cuts and still follow the kings rules each day? --- He can cut one pound off and two pounds off. This would leave a one pound, two pound, and three pound block. On the first day he leaves the one pound block. On the second day he leaves the two pound block. On the third day he leaves the three pound block. On the fourth day he leaves the three pound and one pound blocks. On the fifth day he leaves the three pound and two pound blocks. On the last day he leaves all of them.
 --- 303 --- A man taking the census walks up to the apartment of a mathematician and asks him if he has any children and how old they are. The mathematician says "I have three daughters and the product of their ages is 72." The man tells the mathematician that he needs more information, so the mathematician tells him "The sum of their ages is equal to our apartment number." The man still needs more information so the mathematician tells him "My oldest daughter has her own bed and the other two share bunk beds."<br/><br/>How old are his daughters? --- His daughters are 8, 3, and 3. The prime factorization of 72 is 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3, so the possible ages are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, and 18. Using the prime factorization and these numbers the only combinations of numbers that work for the first clue are:<br/><br/>18, 2 and 2. <br/>9, 4 and 2. <br/>6, 6 and 2. <br/>6, 4 and 3. <br/>8, 3, and 3. <br/><br/>Since he doesn't know the ages after this piece of information the sum of the three numbers must not be unique. The sum of 8, 3, and 3; and 6, 6, and 2 are the same. Now the final clue comes in handy. Since we know that the oldest daughter has her own bed it is likely that she has the bed to herself and is older than the other two so their ages are 8, 3, and 3 rather than 2, 6 and 6.
 --- 304 --- Two men come before the king because one of their beloved pets has been claimed by the other. Both of these men claim that the same cow is theirs. The king declares that one of the men will get the cow and he will give the other man one of his cattle, just to be fair. He will decide which man gets which at random. One of the men thanks the king for his generosity but the other man does not accept the offer. One man leaves with the disputed cow. <br/><br/>Which man gets the cow? --- The one who protests the king's offer must be the owner of the cow, because if it is his beloved pet he wouldn't let chance decide if he gets his cow or not.
 --- 305 --- Of the king I am blue and of the peasant I am red. Of the frog I am cold and of the dog I am hot instead. What am I? --- Blood.
 --- 306 --- You have a horrible disease but thankfully there is a medicine for it. Every day you must take one pill called Batz and one pill called Scatz. On the very first day, you pour one Batz in your hand then you pour two Scatz in your hand by accident! These pills are identical and if you take too much or too little of either pill on any day you will die. You cannot get a refill or throw any pills away. <br/><br/>How can you still take the pills you have in your hand and live? --- To do this you just have to get another Batz and cut all four pills in half taking a half from each pill. Do the same the next day and you will definitely get the right amount of each pill for the two days.
 --- 308 --- Two men find an old gold coin and want to have a coin toss with it to decide who gets it. The only problem is the coin is heavier on one side so it comes up heads more than tails. What is a fair way for the men to toss the coin and decide who gets the coin? --- They just have to flip it twice. They call the first toss either heads or tails, then the next toss they automatically pick the opposite (i.e. if one man calls heads on the first flip, he automatically picks tails on the second and vice versa). If they both win one toss (a tie) out of the two, they just have to repeat until one of them wins both tosses.
 --- 309 --- A king has no sons, no daughters, and no queen. For this reason, he must decide who will take the throne after he dies. To do this he decides that he will give all of the children of the kingdom a single seed. Whichever child has the largest, most beautiful plant will earn the throne; this being a metaphor for the kingdom. At the end of the contest all of the children came to the palace with their enormous and beautiful plants in hand. After he looks at all of the children's pots, he finally decides that the little girl with an empty pot will be the next Queen. Why did he choose this little girl over all of the other children with their beautiful plants? --- The king gave them all fake seeds and the little girl was the only honest child who didn't switch seeds.

When he finishes running by all 100 cells he opens/closes every 3rd cell (starting with 3, 6, 9, 12 etc.), then every 4th cell (starting with 4, 8, 12, etc.) and so on. He does this until he goes around and only changes the 100th cell. <br/><br/>When he is done what cells will be open? --- The cells 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100 will be open. Only the cells that have two of the same factors (4 = 2 * 2) will be open because they are opened and closed the same number of times (except 1 which is just opened). Since they have the same factor twice their number of factors is odd.

To make things fair, the next time they race Trevor stands 5 meters behind the starting line. <br/><br/>Who wins the second race (assuming they run the same speed as the first race)? --- Trevor wins again. In the first race Trevor ran 100 meters in the time it took Tyler to run 95 meters. So in the second race when Tyler is at the 95 meter mark Trevor will also be there (since 100 - 5 = 95). Since Trevor is faster he will pass Tyler in the last 5 meters of the race.

But neither do I.<br/>Sam: In that case, I do know the numbers. <br/><br/>What are the numbers? --- The numbers are 3 and 4. <br/><br/>Since Sam knows the sum of the numbers (x + y) he would only know the answer immediately if the sum was 4 (2 + 2) or 5 (3 + 2). Then when Pete (who knows x*y) knew that Sam didn't know the answer the product must have several numbers that add up to the sum (7 = 3 + 4, 7 = 5 + 2). When Pete doesn't know the answer at this point we know the product must have more than one pair of viable factors (12 = 3 * 4, 12 = 6 * 2). At this point Sam knows the numbers are 3 and 4 because they are the only numbers that meet these criteria.

The prisoners don't know their own hat colour, just the hat colour of those in front of them in line (the first prisoner in line can't see anyone's hat and the last prisoner can see everyone's hat except their own). Starting from the back, one of the guards asks each prisoner what colour their hat is. If they are correct they get to go free but if they are wrong, they go to jail. If the prisoners get to discuss a plan, how can at least 99 of them be saved? --- The back prisoner will yell "black" if there is an odd number of black hats in front of him and "white" if there is an even number of black hats in front of him. The next prisoner will then count the number of black hats in front of him and if it was odd and is now even, or vice versa, then that person knows what colour their hat is. The next person then knows their hat colour based on what the people before them said and how many black hats are in front of them. In this way the front 99 prisoners will know their hat colour and will be set free. The prisoner in the back who goes first has a 50 percent chance of being set free.

Tom can cross in 1 minute, John can cross in 2 minutes, Sally can cross in 5 minutes, and Connor can cross in 10 minutes. If two people cross together they go as fast as the slower person. How can they cross the bridge in 17 minutes or less? --- First Tom and John will cross (2 minutes). Then Tom will bring the flashlight back (1 minute). Next Sally and Connor will cross (10 minutes). Then John will bring the flashlight back (2 minutes). Finally, John and Tom will cross (2 minutes). 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes.

Then he gives the man his $5 in change. <br/><br/>Later the lady from the flower shop confronts the barber and tells him that the $20 bill he gave her was counterfeit. The barber agrees and he gives the lady a different $20 bill. <br/><br/>Later that day he tries to figure out how much money he lost. What did he lose? --- He lost $5. The lady from the flower shop gave him $20 in change, but eventually got $20 back. She broke even. The man who got the haircut gave the barber nothing (except counterfeit money) but got $5 back from the barber. So the barber lost only $5, and gave a free haircut.

They would both agree. If the youngest disagrees then he won't get any gold in the next plan. <br/><br/>So when there are 5 pirates it is in the interest of the 3rd and 5th pirate to accept 1 piece, because if they don't they won't get anything in the next plan.

If I spend about an hour on each meal, that's 3 hours a day or 45 days a year.

Weekends also occur during the summer, so all of these hours are getting counted several times. <br/><br/>Secondly, school isn't an all-day thing.
